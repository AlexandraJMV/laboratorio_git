Well I'm your roll on deodorant honey
Put me under your arm
I'm not stingy like a jellyfish so I won't do you no harm
Well I'm your roll on deodorant baby
I'm specialist goo
You can buy me from a superstore and roll me all over you
Well I'm your roll on deodorant hubby
I'm like a small bald man
I'm an antiperspirant that does not come in a can
Well I'm your roll on deodorant darling
And I smell artificial
I'm a dangerous nuclear weapon, I'm a super fragrant missile
I spent 3 weeks in a factory and 4 days on a shelf
And now I'm on your dresser for the foreseeable future
I spent 3 weeks in a factory and 4 days on a shelf
And now I'm on your dresser for the foreseeable future
Well I'm your roll on deodorant sexy
Silky fine to the touch
Soft and squishy like a teddy bear or a reservoir of pus
Well I'm your roll on deodorant poo poo
Kestrel for a knave
I'm a never-ending worm squiggling through a rave
I spent 3 days in a factory and 4 weeks on a shelf
And now I'm on your dresser for the foreseeable future
I spent 3 days in a factory and 4 weeks on a shelf
And now I'm on your dresser for the foreseeable future
Well I'm your roll on deodorant pal
And I'm all inclusive
I've got full control of your mind but I promise I won't abuse it
Yeah I got you a present, can you guess it? it's me!
I'm roll on deodorant and I'm gonna roll all over your body
